5,2,gb|NC_002695|-|1737553-1737967|ARO:3000676|H-NS,H-NS,"H-NS is a histone-like protein involved in global gene regulation in Gram-negative bacteria. It is a repressor of the membrane fusion protein genes acrE, mdtE, and emrK as well as nearby genes of many RND-type multidrug exporters."
6,2,gb|AP009048|-|4153663-4154296|ARO:3000518|CRP,CRP,"CRP is a global regulator that represses MdtEF multidrug efflux pump expression."
7,2,gb|NC_000913.3|+|3219493-3220873|ARO:3000024|patA,patA,"PatA is an ABC transporter of Streptococcus pneumoniae that interacts with PatB to confer fluoroquinolone resistance."
8,2,gb|KF992028|+|761-1907|ARO:3001839|ACT-18,ACT-18,"ACT-18 is a beta-lactamase. From the Lahey list of ACT beta-lactamases."
9,1,gb|NC_000913.3|-|721055-721733|ARO:3003841|kdpE,kdpE,"kdpE is a transcriptional activator that is part of the two-component system KdpD/KdpE that is studied for its regulatory role in potassium transport and has been identified as an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of pathogenic bacteria. kdpE regulates a range of virulence loci through direct promoter binding."
10,1,gb|DQ679966|+|1515-4662|ARO:3000216|acrB,acrB,"Protein subunit of AcrA-AcrB-TolC multidrug efflux complex. AcrB functions as a herterotrimer which forms the inner membrane component and is primarily responsible for substrate recognition and energy transduction by acting as a drug/proton antiporter."
11,1,gb|AY077482|+|161-1037|ARO:3002391|OXY-1-3,OXY-1-3,"OXY-1-3 is a beta-lactamase found in Klebsiella oxytoca"

The Mfd (mutation frequency decline) protein, also known as transcription-repair coupling factor, is responsible for ATP-dependent removal of stalled RNA polymerase from DNA lesions by inducing forward movement of the RNA polymerase and subsequent recruitment of nucleotide excision repair machinery to the sites of the lesions."
13,1,gb|DQ679966|+|299-1493|ARO:3000207|acrA,acrA,"Protein subunit of AcrA-AcrB-TolC multidrug efflux complex. AcrA represents the periplasmic portion of the transport protein."
