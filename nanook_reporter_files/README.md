NanoOK Reporter files
=====================

Each subdirectory represents a different sample. Within each, you will find:

- reporter - directory containing NanoOK reporter summary files of AMR hits at each chunk point. This is cumulative - i.e. file for chunk X contains all hits found in chunk X and all previous chunks.
- Sample_Template_pass_card_summary_X.txt - a manually updated version of the 6hr AMR file to contain AMR groupings used in heatmaps. This is used by the gather_heatmap_data.pl script. Note: 1) for some samples, this is a time point less than 6hr, if data not available and 2) some of these files have not been updated since an earlier preprint which used more relaxed BLAST criteria. However, this file is only used for translation between AMR genes and manually curated groups, so the lower quality BLAST matches will not make it through to the final analysis.
- Sample_hits_sorted.txt - file generated by gather_heatmap_data.pl which contains numbers of hits to each of the manual AMR groups.
- CARD_chunktimes_Template_pass.txt - timings of each chunk of analysis.
- Sample_Xhrs_chY_walkout_results_independent.txt - walkout results for the sample containing independent hits (at least 50bp away from the AMR hit).
- groups.txt - the names of the manual AMR groups.
- heatmap_timepoints.txt - used by the R script that plots the heatmaps. Relates chunk numbers to hrs.
