2,3,gb|AY587982|+|309-1806|ARO:3000300|lsaA,lsaA,"LsaA is an ABC efflux pump expressed in Enterococcus faecalis. It confers resistance to clindamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and dalfopristin."
3,2,gb|NC_014638|-|1610636-1613960|ARO:3003730|Bifidobacteria,"Bifidobacteria intrinsic ileS conferring resistance to mupirocin","Bifidobacteria have an intrinsically resistant form of ileS (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase) that confers resistance to mupirocin."
4,1,gb|AM180355|+|600033-601953|ARO:3000186|tetM,tetM,"TetM is a ribosomal protection protein that confers tetracycline resistance. It is found on transposable DNA elements and its horizontal transfer between bacterial species has been documented."
5,1,gb|M19652|-|987-1722|ARO:3000250|ErmC,ErmC,"ErmC is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of A2058 of the 23S ribosomal RNA in two steps. Expression of ErmC is inducible by erythromycin. The leader peptide causes attenuation of the mRNA and stabilizes the structure preventing further translation. When erythromycin is present, it binds the leader peptide causing a change in conformation allowing for the expression of ErmC."
