1,4,gb|DQ679966|+|1515-4662|ARO:3000216|acrB,acrB,"Protein subunit of AcrA-AcrB-TolC multidrug efflux complex. AcrB functions as a herterotrimer which forms the inner membrane component and is primarily responsible for substrate recognition and energy transduction by acting as a drug/proton antiporter."
2,1,gb|FJ237368|+|0-1146|ARO:3001830|ACT-7,ACT-7,"ACT-7 is a beta-lactamase. From the Lahey list of ACT beta-lactamases."
3,1,gb|NC_010378.1|+|47850-51003|ARO:3003923|oqxB,oqxB,"RND efflux pump conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone"
4,1,gb|AY661734.1|+|839-2195|ARO:3000026|mepA,mepA,"MepA is an efflux protein regulated by MepR and part of the MepRAB cluster. Its presence in Staphylococcus aureus led to multidrug resistance, while it has also been shown to decrease tigecycline susceptibility."
5,1,gb|AY566250|+|391-1555|ARO:3000391|norA,norA,"NorA is a multidrug efflux pump in Staphylococcus aureus that confers resistance to fluoroquinolones and other structurally unrelated antibiotics like acriflavine. It shares 30% similarity with NorA, and is a structural homolog of Bmr of Bacillus subtilis. It is regulated by arlRS and mgrA, the latter also known as NorR."
6,1,gb|AF173226|+|3767-6917|ARO:3003052|smeB,smeB,"smeB is the inner membrane multidrug exporter of the efflux complex smeABC in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"
7,1,gb|KJ207209|+|454-1600|ARO:3001847|ACT-27,ACT-27,"ACT-27 is a beta-lactamase. From the Lahey list of ACT beta-lactamases."
8,1,gb|NC_000913.3|+|3219493-3220873|ARO:3000024|patA,patA,"PatA is an ABC transporter of Streptococcus pneumoniae that interacts with PatB to confer fluoroquinolone resistance."
9,1,gb|AP009048|-|4153663-4154296|ARO:3000518|CRP,CRP,"CRP is a global regulator that represses MdtEF multidrug efflux pump expression."
10,1,gb|NC_007779|+|1621287-1621671|ARO:3000263|marA,marA,"In the presence of antibiotic stress, E. coli overexpresses the global activator protein MarA, which besides inducing MDR efflux pump AcrAB, also down- regulates synthesis of the porin OmpF."
