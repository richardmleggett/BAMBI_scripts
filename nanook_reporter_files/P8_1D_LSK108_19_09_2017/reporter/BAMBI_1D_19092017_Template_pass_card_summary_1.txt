3,1,gb|NC_000913.3|-|2819380-2822011|ARO:3003830|aminocoumarin,"aminocoumarin resistant alaS","alanyl-tRNA synthetase conferring resistance to novobiocin in Escherichia coli"
4,1,gb|NC_000913.3|-|1170517-1173964|ARO:3003844|mfd,mfd,"mfd dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins. The Mfd (mutation frequency decline) protein, also known as transcription-repair coupling factor, is responsible for ATP-dependent removal of stalled RNA polymerase from DNA lesions by inducing forward movement of the RNA polymerase and subsequent recruitment of nucleotide excision repair machinery to the sites of the lesions."
