1,1,gb|M19652|-|987-1722|ARO:3000250|ErmC,ErmC,"ErmC is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of A2058 of the 23S ribosomal RNA in two steps. Expression of ErmC is inducible by erythromycin. The leader peptide causes attenuation of the mRNA and stabilizes the structure preventing further translation. When erythromycin is present, it binds the leader peptide causing a change in conformation allowing for the expression of ErmC."
