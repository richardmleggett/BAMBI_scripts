1,3,gb|JQ727667|+|0-870|ARO:3000825|robA,robA,"robA is a positive regulator for the acrAB efflux genes, and is structurally similar to SoxS and MarA."
2,3,gb|M95287.4|+|0-828|ARO:3001397|OXA-2,OXA-2,"OXA-2 is a beta-lactamase found in the Enterobacteriaceae family."
3,2,gb|NC_010378.1|+|47850-51003|ARO:3003923|oqxB,oqxB,"RND efflux pump conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone"
4,1,gb|AP009048|-|4153663-4154296|ARO:3000518|CRP,CRP,"CRP is a global regulator that represses MdtEF multidrug efflux pump expression."
5,1,gb|NC_000913.3|-|721055-721733|ARO:3003841|kdpE,kdpE,"kdpE is a transcriptional activator that is part of the two-component system KdpD/KdpE that is studied for its regulatory role in potassium transport and has been identified as an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of pathogenic bacteria. kdpE regulates a range of virulence loci through direct promoter binding."
6,1,gb|DQ679966|+|1515-4662|ARO:3000216|acrB,acrB,"Protein subunit of AcrA-AcrB-TolC multidrug efflux complex. AcrB functions as a herterotrimer which forms the inner membrane component and is primarily responsible for substrate recognition and energy transduction by acting as a drug/proton antiporter."
7,1,gb|NC_000913.3|-|1170517-1173964|ARO:3003844|mfd,mfd,"mfd dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins. The Mfd (mutation frequency decline) protein, also known as transcription-repair coupling factor, is responsible for ATP-dependent removal of stalled RNA polymerase from DNA lesions by inducing forward movement of the RNA polymerase and subsequent recruitment of nucleotide excision repair machinery to the sites of the lesions."
8,1,gb|NC_002695|-|4903561-4904935|ARO:3000830|cpxA,cpxA,"CpxA is a membrane-localized sensor kinase that is activated by envelope stress. It starts a kinase cascade that activates CpxR, which promotes efflux complex expression."
9,1,gb|NC_000913.3|+|3219493-3220873|ARO:3000024|patA,patA,"PatA is an ABC transporter of Streptococcus pneumoniae that interacts with PatB to confer fluoroquinolone resistance."
